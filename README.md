# Project's History
This project came to be as a requirement for my MA 45300 Abstract Algebra. To discuss in detail an application of abstract algebra from past works and develop an approach of the project's holder further than the references.

# Purpose
The purpose for this project was to discuss the properties and lemmas discovered to solve a rubik's cube through group theory. Which meant we could determine impossible and possible configurations of a cube and how to algorithmically solve it.

# Work
The document discusses the theory and algebra of the rubik's cube that inspired the Code. We have three modules, Cube, Solver, and Main. Cube module encodes a virtual cube configuration and also posses algorithm to rotate faces. Solver module (incomplete) would step bu step solve a given configuration. Lastly, the Main module is the module in charge of running the code and having user interface in the terminal. It can generate a solve cube to play with virtually, or accepts an input of a valid cube. It can determine impossible configurations of the cube.
